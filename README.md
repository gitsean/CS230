## Client

The Gaming Room would like to expand their already successful game, Win It or Lose It. They would like to create an in-browser experience, an IOS mobile application, and an Andoid mobile application.

## Documentation

The design document outlines the requirements for creating the application. CIS has made recommendations for the architecture of the application which describe the operating platform, architecture, storage, network, and security to be used for creating the application.

## Code

The Java application has been scaffolded in Maven using Dropwizard. Using an object oriented design ties in with our architecture decisions, keeping the various components of our architecture decoupled. The design decisions outlined in the document are reflected in the code. 

## Process

Working through the design document gave a structured way to plan the development of our application. Knowing how we plan to put things together gives structure to the coding process.

## Todo's

If I could revise the document I might go back and instead of building just an API maybe make use of a query language on the API. This might make queries more flexible so that we can mix and match the type of data we need based upon the screen that the user is in.

## Approach

In the future I would use a similar approach - creating a design document. I think, though, that I would include more pictures. An architecture diagram would make the backend design clear. Some wireframes for the various screens would also be helpful for the front end designer and the end user (or tester).

On that same note, we may want to include some user testing and a plan for how to accomplish that.
